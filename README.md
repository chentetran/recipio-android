# recipio-android

## Android client for Recipio.

A voice-activated cooking assistant app.

Keep your phone/tablet clean while you cook with both of your hands. Recipio will give you step-by-step instructions on cooking. Simply ask for the next step, clarification, or help.

Uses CMUSphinx for keyword spotting and voice recognition, Android's text-to-speech, and Recipio's REST API.

Created at Bridgehacs 2016 Hackathon.

*Non-functional, as CMUSphinx likes to recognize every command twice for some reason*
